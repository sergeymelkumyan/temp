How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    After comparring we have less data and it will be butch easier to find the problem.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If we have bugs in our code, history will help us to go to previous version and solve the problem.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Yes I do, manual saveing helps us to creat history in every step of work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because such files like HTML, CSS, JS are work together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git log we can take the name of commit and with git diff we can compare them and see the changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can save commit and fell more confortable for future steps.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For using previous versions of code and for shareing with code.
